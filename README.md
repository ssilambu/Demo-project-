            A small town, nestled in the rolling hills of Karnataka, buzzed with the quiet rhythm of life. The air, thick with the scent of jasmine and damp earth, carried whispers of ancient secrets. On the outskirts, a solitary oak stood sentinel, its branches gnarled and strong, a silent witness to countless seasons. One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, a young girl named Maya, her eyes bright with curiosity, ventured towards the ancient oak, drawn by an unknown force.
